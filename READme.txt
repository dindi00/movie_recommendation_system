Movie Recommendation System Documentation

1. Overview
⏩The Movie Recommendation System is designed to offer personalized movie recommendations based on user input. It leverages a dataset that includes movie details such as titles, overviews, and genres.

2. Dependencies
This system relies on the following libraries:

⏩Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
⏩Scikit-learn: Utilized for text vectorization and cosine similarity computation.

3. Functionality
⏩Data Loading: Loads the movie dataset from a CSV file.
⏩Data Exploration: Provides summary statistics, identifies missing values, and displays dataset columns.
⏩Feature Selection: Chooses relevant features (id, title, overview, genre) and combines them into a single 'tags' feature.
⏩Text Vectorization: Converts textual data into numerical vectors using CountVectorizer.
⏩Cosine Similarity: Calculates cosine similarity between vectorized text data to assess movie similarity.
⏩Recommendation: Suggests similar movies based on user input by utilizing cosine similarity scores.

4. Usage
⏩Load Data: Use the load_data function to load the movie dataset from a CSV file.
⏩Data Exploration: Utilize the data_exploration function to explore the dataset.
⏩Feature Selection: Apply the feature_selection function to choose and combine relevant features.
⏩Text Vectorization: Use the text_vectorization function to convert text data into vectors.
⏩Compute Similarity: Employ the compute_similarity function to calculate cosine similarity between vectors.
⏩Recommendation: Use the recommend_movies function to obtain movie recommendations based on user input.

5. Development Process
⏩Data Loading and Exploration: Load the dataset and explore its structure to understand its composition.
⏩Feature Selection: Choose relevant features and merge them into a single feature.
⏩Text Vectorization: Vectorize the text data using CountVectorizer.
⏩Cosine Similarity Calculation: Compute cosine similarity between vectors to determine movie similarity.
⏩Recommendation Generation: Input a movie title to receive personalized recommendations.

6. Future Enhancements
⏩Collaborative Filtering: Implement user-based or item-based collaborative filtering for more tailored recommendations.
⏩Additional Features: Integrate more features such as actors, directors, and release years to enhance recommendation accuracy.
